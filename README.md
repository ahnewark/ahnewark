### Hi, I'm Codie ‚≠ê
I'm a software engineer @ Oakbrook Finance \
I'm a full stack developer, currently using C# and React with DDD. \
I have a First-Class Master of Computing degree from the Uni of East Anglia uni where I studied Neuroimaging and Time Series Machine Learning. \
My personal projects tend to involve reversing/archiving games. \
 \
Beyond code, I've been getting really into making music lately! üéπüíÉ‚ú®
