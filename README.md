### Hi, I'm Codie (they/them) ðŸŽµ
I'm a full stack software engineer, currently using C#, NestJS and React with DDD. \
I have a First-Class Master of Computing degree from the Uni of East Anglia uni where I studied Neuroimaging and Time Series Machine Learning. \
My personal projects tend to involve reversing/archiving games. \
 \
Beyond code, I've been getting really into making music lately! ðŸŽ¹ðŸ’ƒâœ¨
