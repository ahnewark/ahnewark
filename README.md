### Hi, I'm Codie
I'm a full stack software engineer, currently using C#, NestJS and React with DDD. \
I have a First-Class Master of Computing degree from the Uni of East Anglia uni where I studied Neuroimaging and Time Series Machine Learning. \
My personal projects tend to involve reversing/archiving games. \
Notably I have recreated webservices and related tooling for Halo 3 and Halo Reach which were shut down in 2021. \
Additionally I created the "Netplay" fork of the Xbox 360 Emulator "Xenia" which features a rudimentary reimplementation of Xbox LIVE web services, and Kernel functions which make use of them. \
